# MongoDB Interview Questions

## Basic Questions

### 1. What is MongoDB?

**Answer**: MongoDB is a NoSQL, document-oriented database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. Unlike relational databases, MongoDB uses a schema-less data model, allowing for more agile and scalable data management. It is known for its high performance, availability, and ease of scalability.

### 2. What are the key features of MongoDB?

**Answer**: Some key features of MongoDB include:
- **Document-oriented Storage**: Stores data in JSON-like BSON documents.
- **Schema-less Design**: Allows for flexible and dynamic data models.
- **Scalability**: Supports horizontal scaling through sharding.
- **Indexing**: Supports various types of indexes to improve query performance.
- **Aggregation Framework**: Provides a powerful aggregation framework for data analysis.
- **Replication**: Ensures high availability through replica sets.
- **High Performance**: Optimized for read and write operations.

### 3. What is a BSON document?

**Answer**: BSON (Binary JSON) is the binary representation of JSON-like documents. It extends JSON by providing additional data types, such as int, long, date, and byte array, making it more efficient for storage and data transfer in MongoDB.

### 4. How do you create a database in MongoDB?

**Answer**: In MongoDB, a database is created implicitly when you insert data into a collection within that database. For example:
```javascript
use myDatabase;
db.myCollection.insertOne({ name: "John Doe", age: 30 });
```
In this example, `myDatabase` is created when data is inserted into `myCollection`.

### 5. How do you create a collection in MongoDB?

**Answer**: Similar to databases, collections are created implicitly when you insert data into them. You can also create a collection explicitly using the `createCollection` method:
```javascript
db.createCollection("myCollection");
```

### 6. What is a replica set in MongoDB?

**Answer**: A replica set is a group of MongoDB servers that maintain the same data set, ensuring high availability and redundancy. It consists of one primary node and multiple secondary nodes. The primary node receives all write operations, while the secondary nodes replicate the data from the primary and can serve read operations.

## Intermediate Questions

### 7. What is sharding in MongoDB?

**Answer**: Sharding is a method of distributing data across multiple servers or shards. It allows MongoDB to handle large datasets and high-throughput operations by horizontally scaling the database. Each shard contains a subset of the data, and a shard key determines how data is distributed across shards.

### 8. How do you perform a query in MongoDB?

**Answer**: To perform a query, you use the `find` method on a collection. For example:
```javascript
db.myCollection.find({ age: { $gt: 25 } });
```
This query retrieves all documents from `myCollection` where the `age` field is greater than 25.

### 9. What is the Aggregation Framework in MongoDB?

**Answer**: The Aggregation Framework is a powerful tool for performing data analysis and transformation operations on MongoDB collections. It processes data through a pipeline of stages, such as `$match`, `$group`, `$sort`, and `$project`, to produce aggregated results.

### 10. How do you create an index in MongoDB?

**Answer**: To create an index, you use the `createIndex` method on a collection. For example:
```javascript
db.myCollection.createIndex({ name: 1 });
```
This command creates an ascending index on the `name` field in `myCollection`.

### 11. What is a capped collection in MongoDB?

**Answer**: A capped collection is a fixed-size collection that maintains insertion order and automatically overwrites the oldest documents when the allocated space is full. It is useful for scenarios like logging or caching, where you need to retain only the most recent data.

### 12. How do you handle transactions in MongoDB?

**Answer**: MongoDB supports multi-document ACID transactions, allowing you to perform multiple read and write operations as a single atomic operation. Transactions are started using the `startTransaction` method and committed using the `commitTransaction` method. Example:
```javascript
const session = db.getMongo().startSession();
session.startTransaction();
try {
  db.myCollection.insertOne({ name: "Alice" }, { session });
  db.myCollection.insertOne({ name: "Bob" }, { session });
  session.commitTransaction();
} catch (error) {
  session.abortTransaction();
}
session.endSession();
```

## Advanced Questions

### 13. What is the difference between `find` and `aggregate` in MongoDB?

**Answer**: 
- **find**: The `find` method is used for querying documents based on specific criteria. It returns documents that match the query conditions.
- **aggregate**: The `aggregate` method is used for data aggregation and transformation. It processes data through a pipeline of stages to produce aggregated results.

### 14. What are the different types of indexes in MongoDB?

**Answer**: MongoDB supports various types of indexes, including:
- **Single Field Index**: Indexes a single field in a document.
- **Compound Index**: Indexes multiple fields in a document.
- **Multikey Index**: Indexes arrays in a document.
- **Text Index**: Supports text search in string content.
- **Geospatial Index**: Supports geospatial queries on location data.
- **Hashed Index**: Indexes a field's hashed value, useful for sharding.

### 15. What is the purpose of the `$lookup` stage in the Aggregation Framework?

**Answer**: The `$lookup` stage is used to perform a left outer join to a collection in the same database, allowing you to combine data from multiple collections. It is useful for enriching documents with related data from another collection.

### 16. How do you perform a backup and restore in MongoDB?

**Answer**: To perform a backup, you can use the `mongodump` utility, which creates a binary export of the database. To restore a backup, you can use the `mongorestore` utility, which imports the binary export into the database.
Example:
```bash
mongodump --db myDatabase --out /backup/path
mongorestore --db myDatabase /backup/path/myDatabase
```

### 17. What is GridFS in MongoDB?

**Answer**: GridFS is a specification for storing and retrieving large files in MongoDB. It divides a file into smaller chunks and stores each chunk as a separate document. GridFS is useful for storing files that exceed the BSON document size limit of 16MB.

### 18. How do you monitor performance in MongoDB?

**Answer**: MongoDB provides various tools and commands for monitoring performance, such as:
- **mongostat**: Provides real-time statistics on MongoDB server performance.
- **mongotop**: Tracks the amount of time MongoDB spends reading and writing data.
- **Profiler**: Captures detailed information about database operations.
- **Monitoring Tools**: MongoDB Atlas and other third-party monitoring tools provide insights into performance metrics.
