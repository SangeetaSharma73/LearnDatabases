## 1. What is SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It is used to store, retrieve, update, and delete data efficiently. SQL allows users to perform operations such as creating tables, inserting records, filtering results, and performing complex queries.

### Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'HR';

```

This query fetches all records from the employees table where the department is HR.

## 2. What are the different types of SQL commands?

SQL commands are categorized into five types:

- **DDL (Data Definition Language):** Used to define or alter database structure. Examples: `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`.
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language):** Used to manipulate data within tables. Examples: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`.
- **DQL (Data Query Language):** Used to fetch data. Example: `SELECT`.
- **TCL (Transaction Control Language):** Used to manage transactions. Examples: `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`.
- **DCL (Data Control Language):** Used for access control. Examples: `GRANT`, `REVOKE`.

## 3. What is the difference between SQL and MySQL?

- **SQL:** A language used to manage relational databases.
- **MySQL:** A relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses SQL.

### Example:

SQL can be used in different RDBMS like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and Oracle.

## 4. What is the difference between a primary key and a unique key?

- **Primary Key:** Uniquely identifies each record in a table. It cannot have NULL values.
- **Unique Key:** Ensures uniqueness but allows one NULL value.

### Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE
);

```

Here, `student_id` is a primary key, and `email` is a unique key.

## 5. What are constraints in SQL?

Constraints enforce rules on data in tables to ensure accuracy and integrity.

- **NOT NULL:** Ensures a column cannot have NULL values.
- **UNIQUE:** Ensures all values in a column are unique.
- **PRIMARY KEY:** Combines NOT NULL and UNIQUE.
- **FOREIGN KEY:** Establishes a relationship between two tables
- **FOREIGN KEY:** Establishes a relationship between two tables.
- **CHECK:** Ensures values in a column meet a specific condition.
- **DEFAULT:** Assigns a default value if no value is specified.

## 6. What is a foreign key?

A foreign key is a column (or set of columns) that establishes a relationship between two tables.

### Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
);

```

Here, `customer_id` in `orders` is a foreign key referencing `customer_id` in `customers`.

## 7. What is normalization? Explain its types.

Normalization is the process of structuring a database to reduce redundancy and improve efficiency.

### Normal Forms:

- **1NF (First Normal Form):** Ensures atomicity (no repeating groups).
- **2NF (Second Normal Form):** Removes partial dependencies.
- **3NF (Third Normal Form):** Removes transitive dependencies.
- **BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form):** Ensures every determinant is a candidate key.

## 8. What is denormalization?

Denormalization introduces redundancy into a database for performance optimization by reducing the need for complex joins.

### Example:

Instead of splitting `orders` and `customers` into two tables, you store customer details inside the `orders` table.

## 9. What are ACID properties in SQL?

ACID ensures reliable transactions:

- **Atomicity:** Transactions are all-or-nothing.
