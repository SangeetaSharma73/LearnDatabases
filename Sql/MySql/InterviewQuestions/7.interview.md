ðŸ”¥ Advanced SQL Interview Questions
1. How do you find the cumulative distribution of a value in a column?
Use the CUME_DIST() window function:

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    name,
    salary,
    CUME_DIST() OVER (ORDER BY salary) AS cumulative_dist
FROM employees;
Explanation: It returns the cumulative distribution of a value within a group, useful for ranking and analysis.

2. What is the difference between RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), and ROW_NUMBER()?
sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    name, salary,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rnk,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dense_rnk,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS row_num
FROM employees;
RANK() skips numbers for ties.

DENSE_RANK() doesnâ€™t skip numbers.

ROW_NUMBER() always gives a unique sequence.

3. How do you update records in one table using data from another?
sql
Copy code
UPDATE employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.id
SET e.department_name = d.name;
Explanation: This is useful when normalizing or syncing data between tables.

4. How do you transpose rows into columns? (PIVOT without pivot keyword)
sql
Copy code
SELECT
    employee_id,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Jan' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS Jan,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Feb' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS Feb,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Mar' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS Mar
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY employee_id;
5. How do you detect and delete orphan records?
sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE customer_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM customers);

DELETE FROM orders
WHERE customer_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM customers);
Explanation: Orphan records are rows that reference non-existent foreign keys.

6. Write a query to get the most frequently occurring value in a column.
sql
Copy code
SELECT column_name, COUNT(*) AS freq
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name
ORDER BY freq DESC
LIMIT 1;
7. What are recursive CTEs? Provide an example.
Used to query hierarchical or tree-structured data.

sql
Copy code
WITH RECURSIVE subordinates AS (
    SELECT id, name, manager_id
    FROM employees
    WHERE name = 'Alice' -- root manager
    UNION ALL
    SELECT e.id, e.name, e.manager_id
    FROM employees e
    INNER JOIN subordinates s ON e.manager_id = s.id
)
SELECT * FROM subordinates;
8. How can you find overlapping date ranges?
sql
Copy code
SELECT a.*, b.*
FROM bookings a
JOIN bookings b ON a.id != b.id
WHERE a.start_date < b.end_date AND a.end_date > b.start_date;
Explanation: Identifies conflicts in schedules like double bookings.

9. Whatâ€™s the difference between UNION and UNION ALL?
UNION: Removes duplicates.

UNION ALL: Keeps all records including duplicates.

10. Find consecutive login dates for each user.
sql
Copy code
SELECT user_id, login_date,
       DATEDIFF(login_date, 
                ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY login_date)) AS group_id
FROM logins;
Group by user_id and group_id to find sequences.
