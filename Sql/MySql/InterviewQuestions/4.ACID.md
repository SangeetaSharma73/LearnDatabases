<!-- ACID Properties in SQL
ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability—four key properties that ensure reliable database transactions.

Atomicity – Ensures that a transaction is all or nothing. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.
Consistency – Ensures that a database remains in a valid state before and after a transaction.
Isolation – Ensures that transactions do not interfere with each other, preventing data corruption.
Durability – Ensures that once a transaction is committed, it remains stored in the database even in case of a system failure. -->
