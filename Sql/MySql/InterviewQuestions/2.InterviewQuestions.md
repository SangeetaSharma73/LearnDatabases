# MySQL Interview Questions

## Basic Questions

### 1. What is MySQL?

**Answer**: MySQL is an open-source relational database management system that uses SQL to manage and manipulate data. It is widely used for web applications and is known for its reliability, performance, and ease of use.

### 2. What are the different storage engines in MySQL?

**Answer**: MySQL supports multiple storage engines, including:
- **InnoDB**: The default storage engine, known for its ACID compliance and support for foreign keys.
- **MyISAM**: Known for its speed and efficiency in read-heavy operations but lacks support for transactions and foreign keys.
- **MEMORY**: Stores data in memory for fast access but is volatile and does not persist data after a restart.
- **CSV**: Stores data in comma-separated values format, useful for data exchange.
- **ARCHIVE**: Optimized for storing large amounts of data with minimal storage space.

### 3. What is a primary key in MySQL?

**Answer**: A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a MySQL table. It ensures that each record is unique and can be referenced efficiently. A primary key column cannot contain NULL values and must contain unique values.

### 4. What is the difference between `CHAR` and `VARCHAR` in MySQL?

**Answer**: 
- **CHAR**: A fixed-length data type. It always uses the same amount of storage space regardless of the actual length of the data.
- **VARCHAR**: A variable-length data type. It uses only as much storage space as needed to store the actual length of the data, plus one or two extra bytes for length information.

### 5. How do you create a new database in MySQL?

**Answer**: To create a new database in MySQL, you use the following SQL command:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
```
Replace `database_name` with the desired name of the database.

### 6. How do you create a new table in MySQL?

**Answer**: To create a new table in MySQL, you use the following SQL command:
```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    ...
);
```
Replace `table_name` with the desired name of the table and define the columns with their respective data types.

### 7. What is normalization in MySQL?

**Answer**: Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing a database into smaller tables and defining relationships between them. The goal is to ensure that each piece of data is stored only once.

### 8. What is a foreign key in MySQL?

**Answer**: A foreign key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table. It establishes a relationship between the two tables and enforces referential integrity by ensuring that the value in the foreign key column corresponds to a valid primary key value in the referenced table.

### 9. How do you join tables in MySQL?

**Answer**: To join tables in MySQL, you use the `JOIN` clause in a `SELECT` statement. Common types of joins include:
- **INNER JOIN**: Returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.
- **LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)**: Returns all rows from the left table and the matched rows from the right table. If no match is found, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.
- **RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)**: Returns all rows from the right table and the matched rows from the left table. If no match is found, NULL values are returned for columns from the left table.
- **FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)**: Returns all rows when there is a match in either left or right table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for the columns from the table that does not have the match.

### 10. How do you optimize a MySQL query?

**Answer**: To optimize a MySQL query, you can:
- **Use Indexes**: Create indexes on columns that are frequently used in `WHERE` clauses and joins.
- **Avoid Using `SELECT *`**: Specify only the columns you need.
- **Use `EXPLAIN`**: Analyze the query execution plan using the `EXPLAIN` command to identify potential bottlenecks.
- **Optimize Joins**: Ensure that joins are performed on indexed columns and consider the order of joins.
- **Limit Results**: Use the `LIMIT` clause to restrict the number of rows returned by the query.

## Intermediate Questions

### 11. What are the ACID properties in a database?

**Answer**: ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. These properties ensure reliable processing of database transactions:
- **Atomicity**: Ensures that a transaction is all-or-nothing.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another.
- **Isolation**: Ensures that transactions are processed independently and transparently.
- **Durability**: Ensures that once a transaction is committed, it remains so, even in the event of a system failure.

### 12. How do you handle transactions in MySQL?

**Answer**: Transactions in MySQL can be handled using the following commands:
- **START TRANSACTION**: Begins a new transaction.
- **COMMIT**: Saves all changes made during the transaction.
- **ROLLBACK**: Undoes all changes made during the transaction.
Example:
```sql
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2;
COMMIT;
```

### 13. What is the difference between `UNION` and `UNION ALL`?

**Answer**: 
- **UNION**: Combines the result sets of two or more `SELECT` statements and removes duplicate rows.
- **UNION ALL**: Combines the result sets of two or more `SELECT` statements and includes all duplicate rows.

### 14. How do you perform a `GROUP BY` operation in MySQL?

**Answer**: The `GROUP BY` statement is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows, like "find the number of customers in each country."
Example:
```sql
SELECT country, COUNT(*) AS customer_count
FROM customers
GROUP BY country;
```

### 15. What is a subquery in MySQL?

**Answer**: A subquery is a query nested inside another query. It can be used in various clauses like `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, etc.
Example:
```sql
SELECT employee_name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE department_name = 'Sales');
```

## Advanced Questions

### 16. What is the difference between `DELETE` and `TRUNCATE`?

**Answer**: 
- **DELETE**: Removes rows from a table based on a condition. It can be rolled back.
- **TRUNCATE**: Removes all rows from a table without logging individual row deletions. It cannot be rolled back.

### 17. What are triggers in MySQL?

**Answer**: Triggers are database objects that are automatically executed or fired when certain events occur. They can be used to perform actions such as logging changes, enforcing business rules, or updating related tables.
Example:
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER before_insert_customers
BEFORE INSERT ON customers
FOR EACH ROW
SET NEW.created_at = NOW();
```

### 18. How do you create an index in MySQL?

**Answer**: To create an index in MySQL, you use the `CREATE INDEX` statement:
```sql
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column1, column2, ...);
```
Example:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_lastname ON employees (lastname);
```

### 19. What is replication in MySQL?

**Answer**: Replication in MySQL is the process of copying data from one database server (the master) to one or more others (the slaves). It is used for redundancy, backup, and load balancing.

### 20. How do you implement stored procedures in MySQL?

**Answer**: Stored procedures are a set of SQL statements that can be stored in the database and executed as a single unit.
Example:
```sql
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE GetCustomer(IN cust_id INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM customers WHERE customer_id = cust_id;
END //
DELIMITER ;
```
