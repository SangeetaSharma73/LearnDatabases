# Difference Between WHERE and HAVING in SQL

## Introduction

In SQL, both the `WHERE` and `HAVING` clauses are used to filter records, but they are used in different contexts and have distinct purposes. Understanding the difference between these clauses is essential for writing efficient and accurate SQL queries.

## WHERE Clause

### Purpose

- The `WHERE` clause is used to filter rows before any groupings are made.
- It is used to specify conditions on individual rows of a table.

### Usage

- The `WHERE` clause is applied before the `GROUP BY` clause in a query.
- It cannot be used with aggregate functions (e.g., `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, etc.)

### Example

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employees 
WHERE department = 'Sales';
```

In this example, the `WHERE` clause filters the rows to include only those employees who belong to the 'Sales' department.

## HAVING Clause

### Purpose

- The `HAVING` clause is used to filter groups after the `GROUP BY` clause has been applied.
- It is used to specify conditions on aggregated data.

### Usage

- The `HAVING` clause is applied after the `GROUP BY` clause in a query.
- It can be used with aggregate functions.

### Example

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS employee_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;
```

In this example, the `HAVING` clause filters the groups to include only those departments that have more than 10 employees.

## Conclusion

The `WHERE` clause is used to filter rows before any grouping occurs, while the `HAVING` clause is used to filter groups after the grouping has been done. Understanding when and how to use these clauses is crucial for effective SQL query writing.

That's it! You now have a clear understanding of the difference between `WHERE` and `HAVING` clauses in SQL. ðŸš€
