ðŸ”¹ 1. SQL JOINs
ðŸ”¸ Theory
JOINs are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

Types of JOINs in MySQL:

INNER JOIN â†’ Returns matching records in both tables.
LEFT JOIN â†’ Returns all records from the left table and matching records from the right table.
RIGHT JOIN â†’ Returns all records from the right table and matching records from the left table.
FULL JOIN â†’ Not supported in MySQL (can be simulated using UNION).
CROSS JOIN â†’ Returns the Cartesian product (every row in one table is combined with every row in the other).
ðŸ”¸ Practical Example
Creating Sample Tables
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    department_id INT
);

CREATE TABLE departments (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    department_name VARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO employees VALUES (1, 'Alice', 1), (2, 'Bob', 2), (3, 'Charlie', NULL);
INSERT INTO departments VALUES (1, 'HR'), (2, 'IT'), (3, 'Finance');
INNER JOIN
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
âœ… Returns only employees who belong to a department.

LEFT JOIN
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
âœ… Returns all employees, even if they donâ€™t belong to any department.

RIGHT JOIN
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
RIGHT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
âœ… Returns all departments, even if they have no employees.

FULL JOIN Simulation (Using UNION)
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id
UNION
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
RIGHT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
âœ… Returns all employees and all departments.

CROSS JOIN
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
CROSS JOIN departments;
âœ… Returns all possible combinations of employees and departments.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Subqueries & Nested Queries
ðŸ”¸ Theory
A subquery is a query inside another query. It is enclosed in parentheses.

Types of Subqueries:

Scalar Subquery â†’ Returns a single value.
Multi-row Subquery â†’ Returns multiple rows.
Correlated Subquery â†’ Uses values from the outer query.
ðŸ”¸ Practical Example
Find employees who work in the IT department using a subquery
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = (SELECT id FROM departments WHERE department_name = 'IT');
âœ… Returns employees working in the IT department.

Find employees who belong to a department using EXISTS
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT name
FROM employees e
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM departments d WHERE e.department_id = d.id
);
âœ… Returns employees who have a valid department.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
ðŸ”¸ Theory
CTEs provide a temporary result set that can be referenced within a query.

âœ… Benefits of CTEs:

Improves readability and reusability.
Useful for recursive queries.
ðŸ”¸ Practical Example
Find employees and their department names using a CTE
sql
Copy
Edit
WITH EmployeeDepartment AS (
    SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
    FROM employees
    LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id
)
SELECT * FROM EmployeeDepartment;
âœ… Makes the query more readable and reusable.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, LEAD, LAG)
ðŸ”¸ Theory
Window functions perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row.

ðŸ”¸ Practical Example
Creating Sample Sales Table
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE sales (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    salesman VARCHAR(50),
    revenue INT
);

INSERT INTO sales (salesman, revenue) VALUES 
('Alice', 5000), ('Bob', 7000), ('Charlie', 7000), ('David', 3000);
ROW_NUMBER
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT salesman, revenue, 
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY revenue DESC) AS rank
FROM sales;
âœ… Gives a unique ranking to each row.

RANK
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT salesman, revenue, 
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY revenue DESC) AS rank
FROM sales;
âœ… Gives the same rank to employees with the same revenue but skips numbers.

DENSE_RANK
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT salesman, revenue, 
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY revenue DESC) AS rank
FROM sales;
âœ… Same as RANK() but does not skip numbers.

LEAD & LAG
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT salesman, revenue, 
       LAG(revenue) OVER (ORDER BY revenue DESC) AS previous_revenue,
       LEAD(revenue) OVER (ORDER BY revenue DESC) AS next_revenue
FROM sales;
âœ… Shows previous and next revenue for each salesman.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Recursive Queries
ðŸ”¸ Theory
Recursive queries allow a query to call itself until a condition is met.

ðŸ”¸ Practical Example
Create an Employee Hierarchy Table
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE employees_hierarchy (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    manager_id INT
);

INSERT INTO employees_hierarchy VALUES 
(1, 'CEO', NULL), 
(2, 'Manager', 1), 
(3, 'Team Lead', 2), 
(4, 'Developer', 3);
Recursive Query to Find Employee Hierarchy
sql
Copy
Edit
WITH RECURSIVE EmployeeTree AS (
    SELECT id, name, manager_id, 1 AS level
    FROM employees_hierarchy
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL  -- Start with CEO
    
    UNION ALL
    
    SELECT e.id, e.name, e.manager_id, et.level + 1
    FROM employees_hierarchy e
    JOIN EmployeeTree et ON e.manager_id = et.id
)
SELECT * FROM EmployeeTree;
âœ… Displays hierarchical relationships using recursion.

ðŸ”¹ 6. CASE Statements & Conditional Aggregations
ðŸ”¸ Theory
The CASE statement allows conditional logic inside SQL queries.

ðŸ”¸ Practical Example
Categorizing Sales Revenue
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT salesman, revenue,
       CASE 
           WHEN revenue >= 7000 THEN 'High'
           WHEN revenue >= 5000 THEN 'Medium'
           ELSE 'Low'
       END AS revenue_category
FROM sales;
âœ… Assigns categories based on revenue.

Conditional Aggregation Example
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN revenue >= 7000 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS High_Sales_Count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN revenue < 7000 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Low_Sales_Count
FROM sales;
âœ… Counts employees with high and low sales.
