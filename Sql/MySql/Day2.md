Difference having and where with example?
🔹 Basic Difference
Clause Used For Works On When It's Used
WHERE Filtering rows Before grouping Filters records before grouping
HAVING Filtering groups After grouping Filters after GROUP BY

🔸 1. WHERE Example (Before Grouping)
Let's say you have a students table:

id name marks
1 Alice 80
2 Bob 50
3 Carol 70
4 Dave 60

✅ Use WHERE to filter individual rows:

SELECT \* FROM students
WHERE marks > 60;
🔸 Result:

id name marks
1 Alice 80
3 Carol 70

🔸 2. HAVING Example (After Grouping)
Let's say we want to find the total marks by each name and filter those with total marks > 100.

Imagine a table:

id name marks
1 Alice 60
2 Bob 40
3 Alice 50
4 Bob 70

✅ Use GROUP BY with HAVING:

SELECT name, SUM(marks) as total_marks
FROM students
GROUP BY name
HAVING total_marks > 100;
🔸 Result:

name total_marks
Bob 110

🔍 HAVING filters the groups after they are created using GROUP BY.

🔸 Can You Use Both?
Yes! You can use both WHERE and HAVING together.

SELECT name, SUM(marks) as total_marks
FROM students
WHERE marks > 30
GROUP BY name
HAVING total_marks > 100;
🧠 Summary
Feature WHERE HAVING
Filters Individual rows Groups created by GROUP BY
When applied Before grouping After grouping
Used with Any query Usually with GROUP BY
